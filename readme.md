### (JavaScript libraries and frameworks)

------------
Arguably, one of the most important languages of today, and tomorrow is JavaScript. The fast growth of the Web has taken the JavaScript to the top levels which led to the revolution of this language ecosystem.

According to the [Stack Overflow developer survey of 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies "Stack Overflow developer survey of 2019") â€“ 69.7% of professional developers chose it as the most commonly used programming language. 

JavaScript has a large number of tools, frameworks, and libraries that make this programming language so popular and so wanted. In this repo, I've collected some useful and popular javascript libraries and frameworks with practical samples which each of them has a separate repository. 

Following this repo contents suggested to all developers if:
- **Neither heard nor used and also you don't know what is it**
- **heard but not used!**

I'm trying to keep this repo updated and refresh. Also, I'd be happy to see contributions with new amazing libraries or frameworks explanation with code samples in a simple and clear way (at least simple than some of the documentations).
